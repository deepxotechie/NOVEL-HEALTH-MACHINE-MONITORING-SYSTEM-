# NOVEL-HEALTH-MACHINE-MONITORING-SYSTEM-
Industrial machines face failures from vibration, noise, and overheating, causing downtime and high costs. Existing systems are costly and unfit for small industries. A low-cost solution uses ESP32 with accelerometer, sound, and temperature sensors, integrated with Raspberry Pi for real-time monitoring.
